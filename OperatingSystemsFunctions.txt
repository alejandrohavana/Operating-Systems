Graphical User Interface (GUI)
It is a function that allows the user to communicate more easily with the computer so that the user can load programs, access files, and perform other tasks. You can 
interact with menus and images by tapping the computer screen or doing it through the mouse, to control a specific software or hardware. There is another type of interface 
that is called a command line interface where interaction with the computer is only possible by entering commands, they do not look like images or interaction menus.
